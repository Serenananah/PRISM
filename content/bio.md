I am a B.Eng. student in Data Science and Big Data Technology at the School of Future Technology, South China University of Technology.  

My current interest focuses on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models and multi-modal learning. Previously, I have worked on efficient historical context truncation and attention mechanisms.
